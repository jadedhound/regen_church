We are a Christian church in the Baptist tradition. Our beliefs are summarised
in the Baptist doctrinal basis. We believe in:

- The divine inspiration and supreme authority of the Scriptures of the Old and
  New Testaments.
- The existence of one God in three persons – the Father, the Son, and the Holy
  Spirit.
- The deity and incarnation of the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the Son of God, the
  second person of the Holy Trinity.
- The fallen, sinful and lost estate of all people.
- The salvation of men and women from the penal consequences and power of sin
  through the perfect obedience of the Lord Jesus Christ, His atoning death, His
  resurrection from the dead, His ascension to the right hand of the Father, and
  His unchanging priesthood.
- The immediate work of the Holy Spirit in the regeneration of men and women, in
  their sanctification, and in their preservation to the heavenly Kingdom of the
  Lord Jesus Christ.
- The necessity, in order to know salvation, of repentance towards God and of
  faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.
- The resurrection of the dead, and the final judgment of all people by the Lord
  Jesus Christ.
- The two ordinances of the Lord Jesus Christ, namely Baptism and the Lord’s
  Supper, which are of perpetual obligation: Baptism being the immersion of
  believers upon the profession of their faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, and a
  symbol of the fellowship of the regenerate in His death, burial and
  resurrection; the Lord’s Supper being a memorial, until He comes, of the
  sacrifice of the body and blood of the Lord Jesus Christ.
