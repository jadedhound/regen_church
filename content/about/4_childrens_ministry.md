At Regeneration Church Monash, we think children are an important part of our
church family! We would love children at our church to know the hope and peace
that Jesus brings. Our children’s ministry is committed to demonstrating that
Jesus welcomes them, and that daily life in Jesus’ lordship is far valuable than
living for anything else in this world, through:

- Presenting the Bible in ways that they understand
- The example of volunteers in our church community
- Providing activities that encourages familiarity with spiritual habits (that
  the family in Christ meet regularly every Sunday to encourage each other, to
  gather around God’s Word, and worship God)

# We run two programs:

## SPROUTS

For toddlers and pre-schoolers (~2 to 5yo)

## BUDS

For children who have started school (5 or 6 to 12yo)

Both programs run during the sermon segment, for approximately 45 mins – 1 hour.

We encourage children to worship with their families at the start of service. As
many young children generally find it hard to relate to adult sermons, we
encourage them to participate in the above programs during the sermon segment.

> All volunteers are Safe-Church trained, and the rooms in which the two
> programs run are set up according to COVID-safe guidelines.
